# Engaging with the Architects of History - A Step Ahead in Conversations  - Conversations Inspired by Wisdom

I initially created this project with the goal of visually emulating the structure of WhatsApp as a demo. I filled the main screen with insightful quotes from individuals who have shaped the course of history, and when sharing the project with you, I thought, "Why not consider engaging in virtual conversations with these significant figures?"

At this moment, I'm looking to take the project a step further. By advancing the main screen, I aim to enable interactions with historical figures such as **Mustafa Kemal Atatürk**. Through the aid of artificial intelligence, you will have the opportunity to engage in virtual dialogues with these great thinkers, ask them questions, and instantly explore their viewpoints with responsive answers.

With this update, our project moves beyond being just a visual demo. By facilitating meaningful interactions with the luminaries of the past, we aspire to provide inspiration and a journey into intellectual exploration for our users. Hopefully, this update will transform our project into a more profound and enriching experience.
